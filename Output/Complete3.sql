When the second fleet arrived in 1790, more than a quarter of its passengers died on the road, and the conditions for the new arrival of the third fleet shocked the first. But Philip was a fine dane for his concerns about the success of the colony, and the well-being of the colonists… regardless of the fact that most of them were criminals. He sent exploratory parties in search of better agricultural land, welcomed commercial ships, promoted public health initiatives, established a number of small satellite regulations to facilitate transhipment, and ignored many old non-essential orders from England.

This division became final in 1054, when the Western (Catholic) Church seceded from the Eastern (Orthodox) Church. The discussion at that time was not superficial, but it questioned whether the popes in Rome were more important than other priests in the city, as well as cultural and religious issues.

After the king realized that the sorcerer had made this speech bitterly, he agreed to go to the court of Tanh.

Civilization, even when it changes or sometimes destroys the natural world, seeks to preserve some of what it has lost, perhaps to see that there is something beyond its understanding. Japanese shinto birds protect their crops from trees, waterfalls, or even deer cows to honor the spirit of nature. Medieval politics and early modern politics in Europe had hunting guards for nobles, where they are often now converted into public parks for the rest and rejuvenation for the masses. These are not the sacrifices that wild animals like Thorau can have, but rather the cultivated and dried wildlife, designed to serve the city''s purpose in beauty, relaxation, hunting, sports, meditation, meditation, meditation, meditation, meditation, meditation, meditation, or just fresh air.'),

American films use zombies as symbols of strange magic that often represent images of racism in the Caribbean or simply "other religions."Otherwise, the zombies appeared because they were afraid of stealing someone''s labor, whether it was a return to proper slavery, or as an example of how chaotic and exploiting new forms of capital appeared in areas such as South Africa.'),

Zombies in the late twentieth century became a new metaphor, appearing as the manifestation of a reckless, blameless consumer; fear of nuclear deterioration; or risk of serious social unrest. In the 21st century, zombies are linked to fear of disease and social breakdown. The tragic wolf emerges from the fear of losing control to the fear of escaping a fantasy after all else has passed away.

This was particularly evident in Queensland''s discovery of gold, which led to the proliferation of gold in the mid - 19th century. Apart from its many national parks, the Great Barrier Reef can be found on most of Queensland''s east coast.'),

('en_US', 'LOC_PEDIA_CIVICS_PAGE_CIVIC_SHEEP_REARING_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1', 'Britain''s lust for wool in the 19th century made the sheep recycling business an important part of Australia''s colonial economy.

This dishonest service system sent prisoners to far - away lands that were difficult and dangerous to build. The prison was usually run by the governor who served as an overseer, and the prisoner did not survive. However, it was an incentive for them to work on their social debt assets for what they had built.'),

The tough colonial judge was not exactly a selling point for successful businessmen and people who wanted to change their fortunes. Thus, a de facto colonial state gave its territory a small subordinate and regional dominion. Political office expanded as the colonies did, allowing the colonial capital to pay (and more importantly, taxes) to colonies outside the country.'),
