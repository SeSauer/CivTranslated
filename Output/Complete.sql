The BBC was commissioned in 1922 as a government-backed operation to provide entertainment and information to the British public.

In Karl Marx''s writings, Marx presents a problem: work creates value, but workers (“proletariat”) receive the minimum wage necessary to nurture and sustain them. All profits go to the person who owns the factory (or farm, or company stock, or, brand, “production method”). For many in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this was like a theft. The owners (“bourgeois”) who did not work stole the fruits of their labor. Thus, the concept of communism was born, that is, the "structure of the proletariat," that is, the rules of the working people, and the free access of workers to the fruits of their labor. This was not equivalent to an “autocratic dictatorship”: in theory, a “proletariat” would ultimately mean everyone, where the worker “according to power and got it as he needed” participated democratically in the government (although working for democratic rule in major communist states was difficult to find in history). However, foreign governments have difficulty implementing this vision. However, we asked ourselves: What should agriculture do? Communism viewed religion as a hoax to keep lower classes in place, but should it be done for workers who felt a deep connection to their beliefs? The Commission viewed the conflict as one that transcended national and ethnic boundaries, but what about those who could not accept international unity? In answer to these questions, Mars'' idea was wrong and wrong. The Soviet Union welcomed the idea that a select group - the Communist Party - should direct responsibility for implementing these changes (creating a “Marxist-Leninist” culture, as we see now in places like Vietnam), and, subsequently, Joseph Stalin reinterpreted nationalism and the idea of a charismatic leader as an anti-nationalist idea. As the Soviets progressed, they became more accustomed to controlling the different voices and tactics that developed and developed. Otherwise, Mao suggested that agricultural workers, not factory workers, should be the target of a movement.

So the Cold War occurred: the capital that opposed the International Commission''s order to crush any nation that wanted to go a middle path, and that often promoted authoritarian regimes that resembled democratic ideals - the worst fear to be made on behalf of the Commission could be Khmer Rouge, a Cambodian Maoist regime that wanted to bring society back to a level of Utopia, and end genocide (again) and kill.
